# WHO AM I

My name is Alejandro Cámara, I'm 29 years old and I grew up in Elche (Spain). Design enthusiast, focused in interaction and experience design.

I've been working as a freelance designer and developer for a couple of years now, working most of the time in web and iOS apps. 

Right now I'm working for Universidad Miguel Hernández de Elche as the main designer and developer for their Master's degree landing pages. [example][masterteleco]  
My approach was to create a modular template (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) so I could easily adapt the information of the +30 Master's degrees.
  
I'm also working for [Symposium Events][symposium] as their main Product Designer. My task consists in trying to update it's interface plus coming up with new features.  
I'm creating a live styleguide so the developers can code the new features. My focus is in creating a modular design system, so every piece of design/code is reusable.
